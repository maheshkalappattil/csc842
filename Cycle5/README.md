# Scan Your ASN

Scan Your ASN is a OSINT tool based on shodan.io.


# DESCRIPTION
There are many layers of protection in place for organizations from internet - firewalls, segmentation, NAT, DMZ to name a few. 
However, it is important to monitor what open source intelligence can be gathered from internet on an organization network.
With this in mind, I built the Scan Your ASN tool that is an extensible framework to monitor and alert of an organiztion level
vulnerability that is exposed to internet.

# Why I'm Interested
I had a raspberry PI exposed to to internet that was running a webserver. It was accessible from internet via port forwarding on
a non standard SSH port. One day I obserevd a file in my root file system that contained the password for my raspberry PI!
It was a CTF attempt by someone who ended up realizing the PI didn't have any valuable information. However it was a lesson to me
to think like a hacker while securing the network.

This tool is an effort to scan an organization network given its ASN(Autonomous System Number) and run various vulnerability checks
including but not limited to:
* any expired certs
* any CVEs identified in any of the devices
* scan for any specific CVE such as heart-bleed
* insecure protocols
* non standard ssh ports
* and much more

This tool is written such that new queries can be added to query table without additional code change.

# Three Main Points
* OSINT scanner on organization ASN using shodan.io APIs
* detects expired certs, insecure protocols, CVEs, insecure file shares
* Ability to extend with new queries without code changee
  
# Pre-requisistes  

This tool is golang based hence uses go runtime. It can be also compiled as a static executable that won't require any dependencies

# Further Areas of Improvement
* Add more queriese
* Scheduled monitoring
* Incoroporate streaming APIs

# Running the tool
go run home_mon.go -asn AS23122

# Resources
* shodan - https://www.shodan.io
